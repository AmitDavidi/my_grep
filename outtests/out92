The storm had felt like thoughumor all day  but now 
the sky was delivering  For   second  like   knife catching   glint of light and refracting

Their mother  Paige  would have told you there was something wrong with Madeline right
aaa

from the start  Her daughters were identical twins  but the resemblance was purely physical 
Madeline had been   difficult baby from day one  She was one who cried nonstop  who
refused to nurse  When Paige would finally get her settled and carefully place her down

again  often waking Erica as well  Paige would want to sob on the floor  she was so 
absolutely depleted 
Madeline was an infant who made Paige understand why Shaken Baby Syndrome was   thing
