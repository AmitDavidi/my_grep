They were identical  but no one would ever mistake one for the other 

And yet  the thought that had hung out in her mind for the past year
said otherwise  They were not so different 

Their mother  Paige  would have told you there was something wrong with Madeline right

from the start  Her daughters were identical twins  but the resemblance was purely physical 
Madeline had been   difficult baby from day one  She was one who cried nonstop  who
refused to nurse  When Paige would finally get her settled and carefully place her down 
she rarely got as far as the nursery door before Madelines blood curdling cries began
again  often waking Erica as well  Paige would want to sob on the floor  she was so
