The storm had felt like thoughumor all day  but now 
the sky was delivering  For   second  like   knife catching   glint of light and refracting
She was kneeling in front of her sister’s grave  She came here often after all 


thats what   mourning sister did but she felt better coming at night  Shrouded

in darkness  she could be hers111 elf  and she could feel what she wanted to which  sometimes 

was nothing [11]   cavernous  echoey space of emptiness  Perhaps there was 2323   bit of pride if 

she were being [9] honest  Along with   genuine sense of connection  even though her sister 


was nothing more than 10  skeleton six feet under  Funny  how it took death to rekindle  

connection that hadn’t [22] existed since the womb  Either way  the emotions weren’t

appropriate for daytime mourning 1

The lightning seemed suitabl[19]e for tonight  It was the anniversary of her

sisters death  And it lit som[11]ething up inside of her too 

dark part of her that she [13]didn’t always feel comfortable 
touching Dark  In the dynamic moment when everything became bright 
she leaned forward and 42 put her lips on the cold stone  She was
certain that whatever plane of ex[1]istence her sister lived on in 
her head was exploding at this artif[0]icial expression of tenderness 
It wasnt totally artificial  It really wasnt  It was just that  in life 
they were polar opposites  Good and bad  Angel and devil  Black and white 
They were identical  but no one would ever mistake one for the other 

And yet  the thought that had hung out in her mind for the past year
said otherwise  They were not so different 

Their mother  Paige  would have told you there was something wrong with Madeline right
aaa

from the start  Her daughters were identical twins  but the resemblance was purely physical 
Madeline had been   difficult baby from day one  She was one who cried nonstop  who
refused to nurse  When Paige would finally get her settled and carefully place her down 
she rarely got as far as the nursery door before Madelines blood curdling cries began
again  often waking Erica as well  Paige would want to sob on the floor  she was so 
absolutely depleted 
Madeline was an infant who made Paige understand why Shaken Baby Syndrome was   thing
